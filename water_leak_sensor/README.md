# Water Leak Sensor

This part of the project sends a signal when a water leak is detected.

**Warning! For this project, I'm using an ATTiny85! If you would also like to use an ATTiny, I would recommend that you learn how to program the chip. If you would like to use another device, check that the pins are the same. If not, change the pins.ðŸ˜‰**
